Description: Vector field consensus (VFC) is an efficient algorithm for establishing robust point correspondences between two sets of points. 
    The C++ / OpenCV source code for the VFC algorithm can be downloaded from GitHub: <https://github.com/jiayi-ma/VFC/blob/master/VFC_opencv.zip>. 
    Several elements of the opencv package configuration have been utilized in this package for loading the OpenCV libraries and facilitating compilation (c/o Jeroen Oooms).
